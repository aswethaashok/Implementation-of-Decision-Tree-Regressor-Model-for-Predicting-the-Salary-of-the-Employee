# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Regressor-Model-for-Predicting-the-Salary-of-the-Employee

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

Import the standard libraries.

Upload the dataset and check for any null values using .isnull() function.

Import LabelEncoder and encode the dataset.

Import DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn and apply the model on the dataset.

Predict the values of arrays.

Import metrics from sklearn and calculate the MSE and R2 of the model on the dataset.

Predict the values of array.

Apply to new unknown values.
